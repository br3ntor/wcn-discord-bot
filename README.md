## WCN Project Zomboid Discord Bot

This bot can control one or more Project Zomboid servers running on a single machine that were installed with LinuxGSM.

### TODO

- Finish getting commands working with new config setup.
- Model rest of the commands after basic flow in send_message
- Fix other non consistent patterns in the code base, system_user vs server_username, stuff like that
- Add the admin role check to all relevant commands
